# `rrcompendium` `README.Rmd`

This `README.Rmd` in `rrcompendium` should contain the title of the compendium, a description, instructions on how to install and reproduce it and details of licensing and how to cite it.

**`README.Rmd`**

The completed file should look like [this](https://github.com/annakrystalli/rrresearchACCE20/blob/master/appendices/rrcompendium-readme.Rmd)

And the rendered version should look a bit like this:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/README-webshot.png")
```
