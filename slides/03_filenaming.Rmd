# File naming

# Background

### Let's face it...

- There are going to be files

- **LOTS** of files

- The files will **change over time**

- The files will **have relationships to each other**

### It'll probably get complicated

---

---

## **Strategy against chaos**

### **File organization** and **naming** is a mighty weapon against chaos

- Make a file's **name** and **location** ***VERY INFORMATIVE*** about:
    - what it is, 
    - why it exists, 
    - how it relates to other things

- The more things are **self-explanatory**, the better.

### **Names matter**

### **What works, what doesn't?**

**NO**

# **Three principles for good (file) names**



1. ### **Machine readable**



1. ### **Human readable**



1. ### **Play well with default ordering**


---

# **Machine readable**

- **Regular expression and globbing friendly**
    + Avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, case sensitivity

- **Easy to compute on**
    + Deliberate use of delimiters

---

## Filtering and search through [Globbing](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/globbing)

### **Excerpt of complete file listing:**

---

### **Example of globbing to filter file listing:**

![](assets/img/plasmid_glob.png)

---

### **Search using Mac OS Finder search facilities**


![](assets/img/plasmid_mac_os_search.png)

---

### **Search using regex in R**


![](assets/img/plasmid_regex.png)

---



## **Delimit information with punctuation** 

**Deliberate use of `"-"` and `"_"` allows recovery of metadata from the filenames:**

- `"_"` underscore used to delimit units of metadata I want to access later
- `"-"` hyphen used to delimit words so our eyes don't bleed


![](assets/img/plasmid_delimiters.png)

---

### Splitting filenames by delimiters

![](assets/img/plasmid_delimiters_code.png)


This happens to be `R` but also possible in the `shell`, `Python`, etc.

---

## **Include important metadata**

e.g. I'm saving a number of files of temperature data extracted at different resolutions (`res`) and for a number of months (`month`). Including these parameters in the filename allows me to use them to target files to read in.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
write.csv(df, paste("variable", res, month, sep ="_"))

df <- read.csv(paste("variable", res, month, sep ="_"))
```

---

## **Recap: machine readable**


- **Easy to search for files later**


- **Easy to filter file lists based on names**


- **Easy to extract info from file names, e.g. by splitting**

**New to regular expressions and globbing? be kind to yourself and avoid**
 + Spaces in file names
 + Punctuation
 + Accented characters



---

# **Human readable**


- **Name contains info on content**

- **Connects to concept of a** [***slug***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_URL#Slug) **from semantic URLs**

---

### **Example**

#### **Which set of file(name)s do you want at 3 a.m. before a deadline?**

![](assets/img/human_readable_not_options.png)

---

## **Embrace the slug**

### Use slugs to link inputs, scripts & outputs

#### **The `R` scripts:**

## **Recap: Human readable**

- $\rightarrow$ **Easy to figure out what the heck something is, based on its name**


---

# **Play well with default ordering**

- **Put something numeric first**
- **Use the ISO 8601 standard for dates**
- **Left pad other numbers with zeros**

---

### Examples

### **Chronological order:**

![](assets/img/chronological_order.png)

---

### Dates

Use the **ISO 8601** standard for dates: `YYYY-MM-DD`

![](assets/img/chronological_order.png)

---

![iso_psa](assets/img/iso_8601.tiff)


---

### **Logical order:** Put something numeric first

![](assets/img/logical_order.png)

---

## Left pad other numbers with zeros

**If you don’t left pad, you get this:**

10_final-figs-for-publication.R
1_data-cleaning.R
2_fit-model.R
~~~

which is just sad :(

## Recap: Play well with default ordering

- Put something numeric first

- Use the ISO 8601 standard for dates

- Left pad other numbers with zeros
