### The paper is the advertisement


> “an article about computational result is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the **full software environment, code and data, that produced the result.**”

*John Claerbout paraphrased in [Buckheit and Donoho (1995)](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab/Wavelab_850/wavelab.pdf)*

### Lessons from the Reproducibility/Replicability crisis

- Many issues statistical and a results of broken Academic incentive systems.

- Much can be tackled by transparency and better computational literacy.

- Publishers: many now require code and data.
    + Specialist journals have emerged for:
      + **software**: [Journal of Open Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org/), [MEE](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/2041210x) 
      + **data**: [Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/))
 
- PIs, Supervisors and immediate research group   

- Your wider scientific community

- The public

## Back to "Why are we here?"

- To show you howto use R + Rstudio to perform reproducible data analyses.

--

- To help you make the most of the real workhorses of your work, **YOUR CODE & DATA**!

--

- To help you be empowered by modern tools & technologies rather than be overwhelmed by them

--

- To help you lead the culture change rather than be burdened by increased requirements

--

- Ultimately, to **change how science works for better for everyone**!

---

- We'll do this by introducing you to **useful data and software tools and best practices**.

# Before we dive in


- We'll exploring best practice in data and workflow management. I've tried to focus on concepts and tools that I wish I knew when I started

--

- We'll explore individual tools and concepts and show how they work nicely together.

--

- We'll be coding together and working in Rstudio Cloud. 


--

- Feedback: After each day, let me know on the notepad:
  - `r emo::ji("green_book")`: somethind you liked
  - `r emo::ji("red_circle")`: somethind that could be improved

--

- Please feel free to ask questions if I use jargon you don't understand or need some clarification.  Questions are helpful for everyone! `r emo::ji("sparkles")`

- Have your mic on mute by default

--

- Please enter questions relevant to the course in the Collaborative notepad under **Participant Questions**

--

- Please ask technical questions in the chat

--

- Please try to help each other!

--

- Use status reaction emojis to communicate how it's going

--

- If you need to get my attention while speaking, raise your hand!
