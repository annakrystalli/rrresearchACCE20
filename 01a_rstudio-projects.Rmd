# Projects in Rstudio

>  Rstudio projects are a convenient way to manage research projects, providing the scaffolding for robust, self-contained and portable work.

## General Project Organisation

**Good project layout helps ensure:**

- Integrity of data
- Portability of the project
- work is easy to revisit after a break and onboard new collaborators
- supports tool building which takes advantage of the shared structure.

### Principles

- Everything required is contained in the project or sourced automatically.
- Use paths relative to the project root directory.
- Separate data, methods, and output, while making the relationship between them clear.
- Document the contents of your project and how to use them.
- Use R package development and community conventions.
- Do not manually edit raw data.
- Keep a [clean pipeline](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2016/08/22/ten-commandments-for-good-data-management/) of data processing from raw to analytical.
- Incorporate checks to ensure correct processing and analysing.

## Rstudio Projects

Rstudio projects are a convenient way to manage research projects, providing the scaffolding for self contained and portable work.

### Features
- Self contained and portable
- Clean environment on load
- Working directory and files tab set to project root


## Rstudio Cloud projects

For the rest of the course, we will be working in a project where I have already set up the computational environment. This will save a lot of time by avoiding having to run a long installation scrip during the class or debug individual installation problems. 


### Launch Rstudio Cloud project 

To access this project, please click on the **supplied project link**

This should drop you into the **ACCE DTP Reproducible research in R Workspace**. If not, navigate to the space from the menu on the top left.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/rsc_space_copy.png", error = FALSE)
```

In there you will find a project called **wood-survey**. Click on **+ Copy** to create your own copy of the project.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/rsc_copy_proj.png", error = FALSE)
```

You now have your own copy of the project.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/rsc_new_proj_name_wd.png", error = FALSE)
```


### Creating projects locally 

To create a new project locally in Rstudio, you can either use **File > New Project > New Directory**, or in the console (you only need to run this once, so you don't want it to be part of a repeatable script) run:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::create_project("~/Desktop/wood-survey")
```

<div class="alert alert-danger">

In general, do not use such hard code paths in repeatable scripts. They might not work across operating systems and are unlikely to generalise across someone elses file system.

</div>

You will also need to run the `setup/install.R` script. See the [setup instructions](#setup) for more details.
